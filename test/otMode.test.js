/**

 * HR's rule, 2026-08-17: in some departments staying past 17:00 on an ordinary
 * day earns nothing — either because the department does no OT at all, or
 * because it is paid a flat daily rate. Working a company holiday still counts,
 * and so does coming in on one's own birthday.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. The rule reads a computed result, so these are the
 * engine's own buckets rather than a fixture asserting what the engine is
 * assumed to produce — which is the point of testing the result and not the
 * calendar.
 *
 * Dates match test/otBirthday.test.js: 4 Aug 2026 is a Tuesday, 11 Aug a
 * Tuesday, and 12 Aug (วันแม่) stands in for the company calendar.
