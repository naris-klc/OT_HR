 *
 * The rule is now that both screens LEAD WITH THE SAME NUMBER — the approved

 * reviewer actually does with the column: they scan it, one number per row,
 * forty rows deep, and the number they were scanning was the one no other
 * screen in the system reports. A label under a headline does not survive being
 * scanned past. The projection they still need is not lost, it is demoted:
 * "+ รออนุมัติ 19" under the figure, and a breach on the row whenever approving
 * the queue would cause one.
 *
