   * THE REASON IS REQUIRED, like every other exception that can move a figure.

   * It was not, until 2026-08-25: an empty body was accepted and stored as
   * "อนุมัติเกินเพดานโดย HR", which is not a reason — it is a restatement of
   * the button that was pressed, written into the record where the reason goes.
   * A row saying somebody approved past a ceiling because they approved past a
   * ceiling is worse than a row with the field empty, because it reads like an
   * answer and cannot be told apart from one.
   *
   * The other exceptions in this system all refuse without one — เซ็นแทนหัวหน้า
   * (`OVERRIDE_NOTE_REQUIRED`), `includeApproved` (`authorizeReplay`) and
   * เปลี่ยนรหัสพนักงาน (`codeChangePermission`). There were four until
   * 2026-08-31; เปิดงวด was the fourth, and it went with ปิดงวด.
   * This one refuses now too, and the screen has
   * always demanded it: `OverrideModal` marks the field required and keeps its
   * save button disabled until something is typed, so no existing path in the
   * application can reach this refusal — it closes the door on the API, which
   * is where the ceiling could quietly be waived with nothing said.
